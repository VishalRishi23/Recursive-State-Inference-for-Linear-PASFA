# Recursive-State-Inference-for-Linear-PASFA
Submitted to the International Conference on Statistics: Theory and Applications (ICSTA) 

• Developed a recursive extension to Probabilistic Adaptive Slow Feature Analysis (PASFA) for improved inference of slow-varying features
in classification and signal analysis tasks
• Designed an algorithm for MMSE estimation of states modeled as an ARMA process, leveraging observations and learned models
• Addressed limitations of traditional Kalman filter approaches in recovering original slow features from transformed state space models
• Demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method through evaluations on synthetic datasets
